I am Tim Burkert a software developer living in Stuttgart Germany, and I am 
writing this blog to write about my experience developing software every day. 
I studied an interdisciplinary academic program, called Informationssystemtechnik, 
at Technical University Darmstadt combining computer science and electrical engineer. 
My interest are mostly around distributed systems and computer architecture.

### Work experience

##### Trumpf

In late 2021 I switched from ZOI to Trumpf. As a consultant at ZOI I already supported Trumpf as 
a software developer. Unfortunately, the projects I am currently working on are not released. 
Therefore, I will disclose the details at this place. 

##### ZOI

I joined ZOI in early 2019 as a firmware developer, but worked mostly as a general software developer. I worked on and 
coordinated projects from bare metal firmware development for cellular and Wi-Fi connected IoT devices to distributed 
CAD/CAM-Systems running on Kubernetes. Working at ZOI was a really nice experience. ZOI itself is quiet intercultural and 
has employees from all around the world. 
 - AWS Lambda based IoT backend system for Kärcher
 - Distributed CAD/CAM-System running on Kubernetes for Trumpf, [Easy Programming Solution](https://easyprogramming.cloud/#/)
    - Improved scalability and collision avoidance during laser cutting
 - Customizing Ubuntu for fully automated cleaning appliance based on ROS and electron user interface
