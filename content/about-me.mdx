I am Tim Burkert a software developer living in Stuttgart Germany, and I am
writing this blog to write about my experience developing software every day.
I studied an interdisciplinary academic program, called Informationssystemtechnik,
at Technical University Darmstadt combining computer science and electrical engineer.
My interest are mostly around distributed systems and computer architecture.

### Work experience

#### Trumpf

In late 2021 I switched from ZOI to Trumpf. As a consultant at ZOI I already supported Trumpf as
a software developer. Unfortunately, the projects I am currently working on are not released.
Therefore, I will not disclose the details at this place.

#### ZOI

I joined ZOI in early 2019 as a firmware developer, but worked mostly as a general software developer. I worked on and
coordinated projects from bare metal firmware development for cellular and Wi-Fi connected IoT devices to distributed
CAD/CAM-Systems running on Kubernetes. Working at ZOI was a really nice experience. ZOI itself is quiet intercultural and
has employees from all around the world.

- AWS Lambda based IoT backend system for KÃ¤rcher
- Distributed CAD/CAM-System running on Kubernetes for Trumpf, [Easy Programming Solution](https://easyprogramming.cloud/#/)
  - Improved scalability and collision avoidance during laser cutting
- Customizing Ubuntu for fully automated cleaning appliance based on ROS
